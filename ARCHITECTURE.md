# System Architecture Overview

This system is designed as an Agentic AI workflow, not a chatbot.

## High-Level Flow
1. Document upload triggers the system
2. Content is extracted automatically
3. The AI agent reasons over the content
4. A structured summary is generated
5. Output is stored as business knowledge

## Why This Is Agentic AI
- Runs automatically without manual prompts
- Uses tools to process documents
- Applies multi-step reasoning
- Stores outputs for reuse

## Key Characteristics
- Goal-driven execution
- Persistent memory
- Action-oriented design
- Business-first outputs

This architecture focuses on outcomes, not conversations.
