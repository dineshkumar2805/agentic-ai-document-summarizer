# Agentic AI Document Summarizer

Turn everyday business documents into structured, usable knowledge — automatically.

## The Problem
Businesses deal with documents every day:
PDFs, Word files, presentations, reports, policies, research, compliance files.

These documents are stored, but rarely used.
Manual reading and summarization is slow, inconsistent, and expensive.

## The Solution
This project demonstrates an Agentic AI system that:
- Accepts any document format
- Reads and understands context
- Generates clear, business-ready summaries
- Stores knowledge for future reuse

This is not a chatbot.
This is an AI agent that completes work.

## Business Outcome
- 30–60 minutes per document → under 1 minute
- Up to 95% time saved
- Faster decisions
- Lower operational cost
- Centralized business knowledge

## Who This Is For
- SMBs & Enterprises
- Legal, Finance, Consulting teams
- Research & Compliance-heavy businesses
